<p>Venice, 1524: The nobleman and anti-Semite Don Gabriel Moro is
sentenced to death for sodomy and decapitated. Two years later, Don
Gabriel's man servant, the dwarf Tadzio, spends his last days writing
his master's story. Why did he betray his beloved master? And who is
the silent stranger waiting for him to die?</p>

<p>Loosely based on the real story of Don Gabriel Moro, <em>Where the Light
Enters</em> is a novel about the relationship between a powerful nobleman
and his servant, about lust, jealousy and ill-fated love. The book
also deals with the circumstances that led to the creation of the
world's first Jewish ghetto in 1516 and the burgeoning scientific
experimenting during the same period that would eventually change the
Western world view.</p>

<p>(From Aschehoug Agency's web page)</p>

<p>&quot;A literary breakthrough for Moro, with the potential to become an
international bestseller. (&#8230;) Everything falls into place in a historical
novel about the persecution of jews, murder, syphilis and sodomy, hatred and
love. (&#8230;) In addition to having written a page turner, Moro displays an
impressive insight into the history of ideas. (&#8230;) Thomas Mann's Doktor
Faustus and Tadzio from Death in Venice are obvious references, in a novel which
fully equals the many bestselling historical novels in recent years.&quot;
(Dagbladet)</p>

<p>&quot;Dan Brown and Khaled Hosseini can take a hike. Gabriel Michael Vosgraff
Moro is a young author to have expectations of. (&#8230;) [The novel] combines
the traditional composition of fairy tales, where page turner devices are at
play, with the open ending of the modern novel. One has every reason to praise
Moro for a brilliant piece of work. <em>Where the Light Enters</em> holds all
the qualities necessary to become his literary breakthrough.&quot;
(Klassekampen)</p>

<p>&quot;Successful double dealing &#8230; professionally written and clearly on
an international level, this is an unusually good candidate for translation into
other languages &#8230; a very safe choice for a christmas gift.&quot; (Dagens
N&#230;ringsliv)</p>

<p>&quot;One of this autumn's surprises! A 28 year old Norwegian author embarks
upon a dangerous project by placing his gripping tale of eroticism, love and
conflicting ideas in 16th century Venice. He sees it through with elegance and
grace.&quot; (Sverre M&#248;rkhagen, Dagbladet)</p>

<p>&quot;an impressive piece of work (&#8230;) This is an abundant, entertaing
and well written novel.&quot; (Stavanger Aftenblad)</p>

</div>

<p>It is the summer of 1989 and a car is motoring down the <em>autobahns</em>
from Norway to Austria. Inside the car are an eight-year-old boy and
his family. Through the car window the boy catches sight of a trailer
full of pigs on their way to the slaughterhouse, and he is shocked by
the sight.</p>

<p>The memories from the autobahn continue to haunt the protagonist
through adulthood. Although he hopes that he can come to terms with
the past and the world he is doomed to live in, as a protest &#8211; and in
despair that everything could have been different &#8211; he goes on a
mental journey to save what he can before it is too late.</p>

<p><em>Autobahn</em> is an exciting, unusually intense novel with a very
individual narrator's voice.</p>
